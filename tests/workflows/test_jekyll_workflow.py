Comprehensive test suite for .github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml

This test suite validates the GitHub Actions Jekyll deployment workflow including:
- YAML syntax and structure
- Workflow metadata (name, triggers)
- GitHub Pages permissions configuration
- Concurrency control
- Build and deployment job definitions
- Jekyll-specific actions and configurations
- Security best practices
